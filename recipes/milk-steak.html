            <ol>
                <li>Add the milk, honey, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to a medium sized saucepan. Then heat up the mixture, stirring until the honey has been completely dissolved.</li>
                <li>After bringing the mixture to a boil. Carefully place the steak in the boiling milk mixture. Bring the liquid back to a boil and reduce the heat so that the milk is simmering.</li>
                <li>Cook the steak for about 5 minutes on on side, stirring the top occasionally to stop a skin forming on the milk. Then turn the steak over and cook for another 5 minutes on the other side.</li>
                <li>Check how well cooked your steak is. If cooked to your liking, serve with a side of jelly beans.</li>
